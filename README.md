**Problem Statement:**

In our workflow, we require backlog data, which currently does not exist in any of our data systems. Backlog refers to the quantity of goods that have not yet been stowed in our fulfillment centers (FCs).

This backlog data is crucial for our inventory planning and allocation processes. Our team is responsible for providing this data to other stakeholders, including the Inventory Control and Allocation and SNOP teams.

Currently, there is no centralized knowledge of the backlog data for each FC; only the FC teams have this information. We have coordinated with the FC teams, and they have agreed to input the backlog data into a shared Excel file on Microsoft SharePoint.

With approximately 60 FCs across the country, the challenge lies in managing the data input to ensure consistency in the format and subsequently transferring this data into our Amazon Redshift database.
